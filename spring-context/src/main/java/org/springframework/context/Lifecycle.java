/**
 * A common interface defining methods for start/stop lifecycle control.
 * The typical use case for this is to control asynchronous processing.
 * <b>NOTE: This interface does not imply specific auto-startup semantics.
 * Consider implementing {@link SmartLifecycle} for that purpose.</b>
 *
 * <p>Can be implemented by both components (typically a Spring bean defined in a
 * Spring context) and containers  (typically a Spring {@link ApplicationContext}
 * itself). Containers will propagate start/stop signals to all components that
 * apply within each container, e.g. for a stop/restart scenario at runtime.
 *
 * <p>Can be used for direct invocations or for management operations via JMX.
 * In the latter case, the {@link org.springframework.jmx.export.MBeanExporter}
 * will typically be defined with an
 * {@link org.springframework.jmx.export.assembler.InterfaceBasedMBeanInfoAssembler},
 * restricting the visibility of activity-controlled components to the Lifecycle
 * interface.
 *
 * <p>Note that the present {@code Lifecycle} interface is only supported on
 * <b>top-level singleton beans</b>. On any other component, the {@code Lifecycle}
 * interface will remain undetected and hence ignored. Also, note that the extended
 * {@link SmartLifecycle} interface provides sophisticated integration with the
 * application context's startup and shutdown phases.

	 * <p>Note that this stop notification is not guaranteed to come before destruction:
	 * On regular shutdown, {@code Lifecycle} beans will first receive a stop notification
	 * before the general destruction callbacks are being propagated; however, on hot
	 * refresh during a context's lifetime or on aborted refresh attempts, a given bean's
	 * destroy method will be called without any consideration of stop signals upfront.
	 * <p>Should not throw an exception if the component is not running (not started yet).

	 * that apply.
	 * 通常以同步方式停止此组件，以便在返回此方法时完全停止该组件。当需要异步停止行为时，应考虑实现SimultLIFECKEY及其停止（RunnEnable）变体。
	 * 请注意，此停止通知不保证在销毁之前发出：在定期关闭时，Lifecycle Bean将在传播常规销毁回调之前首先收到停止通知；
	 * 但是，在上下文的生命周期内进行热刷新或刷新尝试中止时，将调用给定bean的destroy方法，而不预先考虑停止信号。
	 * 如果组件未运行（尚未启动），则不应引发异常。 对于容器，这将向所有应用的组件传播停止信号
